# Code Refractoring for Horiseon

## Description

I was 'contracted' by Horiseon, a company specializing in online marketing, to bring their codebase
in line with accessibility standards and ensure it was optimized for search engines. 

First, I gave the page a proper title and replaced the '<div>' tags used throughout the website with semantic tags implemented in HTML 5. Second, I took advantage of that change to organize and consolidate the associated CSS code. Third, I added alt titles for all image content included in the HTML file, aiming to be concise while still conveying the story Horiseon intended the images to tell. Finally, I improved the readability of the code by adding comments and ensuring the syntax was consistent.

The new codebase meets Horiseon's requirements for the present and will be easier to modify in the future.

## 'Installation'/Usage

The site can be accessed at [https://mavn2.github.io/Horiseon/](https://mavn2.github.io/Horiseon/). 
The codebase is stored in the Horiseon repository on my Github page, [https://github.com/mavn2](https://github.com/mavn2).

## Tests

The alt titles can be tested by simply cloning the repository, removing the images from the Horiseon/assets/images folder, and opening the index.html file located in the Horiseon folder.
